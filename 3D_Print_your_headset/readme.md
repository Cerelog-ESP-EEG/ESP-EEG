As a cost-effective alternative, you can build your own data acquisition cap by using the 3D print files for the Ultracortex Mark III headset, a third-party project: https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ultracortex/tree/master/Mark_3

To make this headset compatible with the Cerelog ESP-EEG PCB, you must also print our special adapter plate (using the .stl file) and secure it to the headset with bolts or zip ties. The file had been included here as adaptor.stl


Note: If someone creates a case for this please email me at simon@cerelog.com, id love to include it here
I think a lot of people would benefit but didn't have enough time to cad one up
