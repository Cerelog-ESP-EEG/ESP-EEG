# ESP EEG Hardware Reference

This directory contains the schematics for the ESP EEG platform by Cerelog Inc.



We love the hacker community! We explicitly grant permission for **Personal & Educational Use**.

*   **Can I build my own ESP EEG?**
     If you are a student, hobbyist, or researcher, you are welcome to use our schematics to layout and assemble your own version of this board for your own personal use.

*   **Can I sell the board I built?**
    NO. You may not sell devices based on this design. The license is strictly **Non-Commercial**.

*   **Where are the PCB Layout files?**
    We do not release the PCB layout (Gerber) files. To build your own, you will need to re-route the PCB yourself using the provided schematic. We encourage this as an advanced learning exercise in mixed-signal design!


    
## ⚠️ Licensing & Cloning Policy

**Why?**
Cerelog Inc. is a small, independent company. The sales of this hardware support the development of the open-source firmware, software, and future products. 
We have chosen **not** to release the PCB layout (Gerber) files at this time to prevent low-quality clones from flooding the market and undermining our ability to support this platform.
